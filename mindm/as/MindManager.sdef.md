The four values represent offsets from the staring or ending location to the corresponding control point. The first two values represent the horizontal and vertical offsets respectively for the control point connected to the starting location. The third and fourth values define the offset for the control point connected to the ending location.

    - `name space` (`Nspc`, type `text`): Name spaces are used to help prevent clashes between attributes with the same name. Each application or script should define it's own name space and use that name space for all its attributes. A good choice for a name space is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), but that is not a requirement. A name space cannot contain the '#' character
    - `name` (`pnam`, type `text`): The common name or identifying key for this attribute. Names must consist of only letters, numbers, and underscore characters. The first character must be a letter
    - `value` (`valu`, type `text`): A text string that defines the value of the attribute.
